What is this?
-------------

This is the base-styles node package for the Chicago Tribune DataViz team. It relies on node/npm and uses some components from other open-source projects (such as Skeleton and Foundation)


How do I install this?
----------------------

At the moment, you can use `npm install git+https://tribune.unfuddle.com/git/tribune_trib-styles/`. Don't forget to `--save-dev` to add it to your package.json.


Shouldn't this readme be longer?
--------------------------------

Maybe. But what you want is probably in the companion [style guide](##link me##). The guide, built with Tarbell, is a living style guide and gives examples and instructions for most anything you would want to know. This includes best practices, local style preferences, code examples and more.
